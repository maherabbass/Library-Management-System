# LOCAL DEV: leave VITE_API_URL empty (or omit this file entirely).
# The Vite dev/preview proxy in vite.config.ts forwards /api/* to the backend
# transparently — no CORS issues, no extra config needed.
#
# PRODUCTION (Netlify/Vercel): set VITE_API_URL as a build-time env var in
# your hosting dashboard, not here.
#
# VITE_API_URL=https://library-app-qtegugoc4a-ew.a.run.app
